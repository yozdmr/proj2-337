# Part 2

## Setup

You will need your own Gemini API key per the instructions in Canvas, saved as `GEMINI_API_KEY` in a `.env` file.

Run the app using `python app.py` while in the `/part3` directory. You can also reuse the front end from Part 1, per the instructions in `/part1/README.md`. If the front end from Part 1 and the back end from Part 2 is running, they will work together seamlessly.
